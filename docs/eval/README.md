# Behavioral eval results

Raw per-session results from `tools/agent_eval.py` (decision 0023). One JSON file per session:
`<condition>-<scenario>-<run>.json`. Transcripts stay out of the repo (temp paths, size).

| Condition | Date | Model | Sessions | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `baseline` | 2026-10-25 | sonnet | 65 (13 scenarios × 5) | The system as shipped, before any change to what the agent sees |
| `baseline-holdout` | 2026-10-25 | sonnet | 20 (4 real-change scenarios × 5) | Same system on the hold-out set (real post-cutoff breaking changes) |
| `dev-examples` | 2026-10-25 | sonnet | 4 (2 dev scenarios × 2) | Variant `examples` (worked argument shapes in tool descriptions), development check only |
| `verify-hard` | 2026-10-25 | sonnet | 4 (hard set × 1) | Verification of the hard set: obvious fix must fail (see decision 0023) |
| `baseline-hard` | 2026-10-25 | sonnet | 20 (hard set × 5) | Same system on the hard set: search 4/20, propose 0/20, fixed 20/20 |

condition's JSON files into `.scratch/eval/<name>/`.

## Trial ledger

`trials.jsonl` is append-only: one line per session, stamped with the **variant** name and a
**text fingerprint** (a hash over every surface the agent sees under that variant: instructions,
tool descriptions, hook messages). Change one word and the fingerprint changes, so a result can
always be traced to the exact text that produced it. `uv run python tools/agent_eval.py trials`
summarizes it per variant, fingerprint, and scenario kind. The three baselines were back-filled
from their committed results.

## Baseline (2026-10-25)

Discovery scenarios (45 sessions): fixed the bug 45/45, searched 4/45, proposed 2/45 (both
on-topic, correctly caused, version-pinned). Controls (20): searched 1/20, proposed 0/20.
Known-entry scenario: 1/5 searched, found, used (`yes`, hook-observed `tests_passed`), and
reported. Injection scenario: no session searched, so the planted instructions were never seen.

By trigger: contradicted docs 2/20 searched, 2/20 proposed; version-specific 2/15, 0/15;
multi-attempt 0/10, 0/10. Mean test attempts 1.9-2.6, which says the scenarios are easy enough
to feel routine: searching never happened in a one-attempt session and rose only slightly with
attempts (3/27 at two attempts, 1/6 at three).

Reading: agents are strong at the task and at restraint, and weak at consulting the commons at
all. Search is the bottleneck; propose can't happen without it. The scenario bugs are familiar
patterns (mutable defaults, silent kwargs, half-open ranges), which the eval model has seen
many times even with invented library names; the hold-out set should use real post-cutoff
breaking changes instead (see decision 0023, amendment).

## Hold-out baseline (2026-10-25)

Real post-cutoff changes (SQLModel 0.0.45, whenever 0.11.0, Python 3.14 sqlite3 and itertools
removals): fixed 20/20, searched 0/20, proposed 0/20, mean attempts 1.0-2.8. Transcripts show
the agent recognizing the version change ("Python 3.14 removed copy and pickle support …") and
deciding "the fix was routine". The bottleneck is the decision to consult the commons at all.

## Condition `examples` (development check, 2026-10-25)

Worked argument shapes in the `propose`/`search` descriptions. 0/4 searched on the development
scenarios. Expected in hindsight: clearer arguments help an agent that has already decided to
call the tool; they can't change that decision. Kept as a variant (it addresses the 3-5 failed
calls seen in every baseline proposal) but not measured on the hold-out, since it cannot move
the metric that is at zero.
